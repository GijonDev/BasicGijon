## FAQ

### Q: What is Root used for?
A: Root is a very basic file that can create randomized numbers, output system information, output java current version, attempt to fix connectivity problems, output information about the connection between you and a host and access cmd.exe without permissions.

### Q: How long have you been developing Root for?
A: I've been developing Root for almost 2 years now, and it has consumed somewhere around 100 hours of my stupid life.

### Q: Why did you start programming Root?
A: Root wasn't supposed to be what it is, it started as a Battlefield 1942 patch downloader not so many time ago. I started developing the idea and created other files surrounding it. Nowadays, the files are combined into the one and only, Root. In fact, patch-1 needed all the files for "GijonRoot.bat" to work as intended.

### Q: Why has Root changed filenames so many times?
A: Basically because I didn't have a clear idea of how to call it. I expect it to remain as it is right now for a long time.

### Q: Why .cmd and not .bat?
A: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21580423/7049909

### Q: Why do you code on Batch instead of coding on something more useful?
A: Because this is the only language I can properly code on and I'm not willing to sacrifice more time and mental health in coding. However, I've tried to code on other languages like C, VBS, Shell, Python, Java and more recently C++, but that hasn't gone well at all.

### Q: Why do you even bother to answer questions if nobody will ever see them?
A: I like to think that I'm some kind of famous idiot on the internet. (basically because I'm fucking idiot)
