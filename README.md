[cecho.exe](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/1uYvfQCNm75uBDCStHnzKKUWxRnNlD9KJpvRNeZwt6vvJ7Ishpz428Ebv74fDXWd/file?dl=1) is a little tool created by Thomas Polaert that takes care of the color of a line without changing the rest of the lines. Root can use this tool since patch-15 even if it's completely optional. To install it properly you just need to put it inside system32 or indicate its path to Root using "install_cecho".

*NOTE: It may look inactive. It is not, I'm just busy with another stuff.*
